# Mech-Index

First I learned how to make a web scraper. Then I used it to scrape Battlemechs from the [MUL Online Database](http://www.masterunitlist.info/Unit/Filter). Then I populated my own local sqlite db with the information, and created an app to access it via FastAPI.

There is no express purpose for this app, it is simply training.
